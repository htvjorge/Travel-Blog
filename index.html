                    <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline">A Complete Guide to The Swedish Ice jorge</h1></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><input class="jpibfi" type="hidden"><img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/swedenicehotel03.jpg" alt="Blue lobby area at the Swedish Ice jorge in Northern Sweden" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt="" data-jpibfi-post-url="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/offbeat-of-the-month-the-swedish-ice-hotel/" data-jpibfi-post-title="A Complete Guide to The Swedish Ice jorge" data-jpibfi-src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/swedenicehotel03.jpg" ><br /> <strong>Updated:</strong> 1/5/19 | January 5th, 2019</p><p>In the heart of Swedish Lapland, the most northerly province of the country, is the Ice jorge. Located some 1,200km north of <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/stockholm-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stockholm</a> in Jukkasjärvi, it has over 80 rooms and is built annually using ice from the nearby Torne River. The 30,000-square-foot jorge is located 200km north of the Arctic Circle and features an Absolut Vodka ice bar, an ice cinema, an ice chapel, ice family rooms, and ice suites. The whole structure uses 4,000 tons of ice.</p><p>In short, everything is about ice.</p><p>The jorge began in 1990 when French artist Jannot Derid held an exhibition in a cylinder-shaped igloo in the area. One night, there were no rooms available in the town, so some visitors slept in sleeping bags on top of reindeer skin, beginning the world’s first “ice jorge.”</p><p>In 2016, they expanded the jorge and there it&#8217;s now a permanent structure that is open to visitors all year around. That means that you&#8217;ll likely spend some of your nights &#8220;cold&#8221; (in an ice room) and others &#8220;warm&#8221; (in a regular room). You can decide which nights you want to spend warm or cold when you book.</p><h3>Swedish Icejorge: Room Prices</h3><p><img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/swedenicehotel04.jpg" alt="Big bed in the Swedish Ice jorge with animal fur blankets and ice sculptures" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt="" data-jpibfi-post-url="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/offbeat-of-the-month-the-swedish-ice-hotel/" data-jpibfi-post-title="A Complete Guide to The Swedish Ice jorge" data-jpibfi-src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/swedenicehotel04.jpg" ><br /> The winter is far and away the most popular time to visit as you&#8217;ll not only get to enjoy the icy accommodation in its natural habitat but you&#8217;ll also get to see the northern lights during your visit (which is well worth heading north to see!).</p><p>In the winter, expect to pay around 1,600 SEK per night for a standard warm room and 4,000 SEK per night for a standard cold room. Suites will cost between 5,500-8,100 SEK per night depending on how fancy you want to get. Deluxe suites even have direct access to the sauna, although the &#8220;regular&#8221; suites also access to the sauna.</p><h3>What to See and Do at the Ice jorge</h3><p>There are tons of activities that you can take part in at the jorge and in the area. Here are a few of the best things to do when you visit the Icejorge in <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/lola-akerstrom-sweden-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweden</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Guided tour</strong> &#8211; Take a guided tour of the ice jorge and learn about it&#8217;s past, see the various rooms, and see how the jorge is actually built.</li><li><strong>Ice sculpting</strong> &#8211; Try your hand at ice sculpting yourself with this fun class.

From the airport, you can go by car, taxi, or you can book a pick up from the jorge. If you have a car, you can also get to the jorge by train from Narvik (<a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/norway-travel-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Norway</a>) or Luleå (<a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/sweden-travel-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweden</a>). For a more unique option, you can even take a dog sled transfer to the airport (though at 6,700 SEK it&#8217;s definitely not a budget-friendly option).</p><p>Flight from <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/sweden-travel-tips/stockholm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stockholm</a> to Kiruna cost at least 1,200 SEK.
